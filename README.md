# Traffic-Aanalysis-using-LSTM
Built an LSTM-based deep learning model in Keras to forecast hourly traffic volume from time series data. Achieved RMSE â‰ˆ 0.24 with strong correlation between actual and predicted trends using scaled inputs. Implemented future-step forecasting and visualized performance through inverse-transformed plots.
